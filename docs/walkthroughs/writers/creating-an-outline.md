title: "Creating an outline"

During the workflow of a deliverable, a writer will be assigned the "outline". This is a special state in the workflow which requires the writer to produce a high-level, general outline of what they are going to write about.

Outlines are critical part of the writing process. Having them available for the draft ensures that a writer doesn't spend undue amounts of time writing the wrong things for the wrong reasons.
