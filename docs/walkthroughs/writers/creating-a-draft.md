title: "Creating a draft"

During the workflow of a deliverable, a writer will be assigned the "draft". This is a special state in the workflow which requires the writer to produce a high-quality written piece, based on the outline that was previously approved.

Drafts are the core part of the writing process. These typically will have a lot of iteration and back and forth with the reviewer, ensuring that the stakeholders have a time and place to give input without disrupting the writing process.

While writing, you'll have quick and easy access to:

- Deliverable requirements
- Your approved outline
- Your research
- Comments that your reviewer may have left during a review cycle

Having all of this right where you're writing provides a highly efficient methodology for creating content.
