### Persona
During your onboarding you were asked to set yourself as a manager or a writer. Here you can alter this setting.

### Avatar
In your account, you can set your **avatar**, which will allow others within Vewrite to easily find you.

To do so, please select an image from your local computer and upload it to Vewrite.
