title: "Reviewing an outline"
---

Outlines are critical part of the writing process. Having them reviewed and approved means that the writer can focus on creating the best possible draft based on an agreed upon structure. This often provides a faster, more efficient writing process with less back and forth on the basic structure of the content.

### Reviewing an Outline

Reviewing an outline is a strightforward process. When the writer feels that their outline is ready, they click the "send for review" button and the workflow moves to the "Outline Review" state. In this state, the deliverable is assigned to the reviewer role, and they are now able to:

- Add comments
- Highlight text
- Strike out text
- Make critical changes

While the deliverable is in the "Outline Review" state, the writer is not able to make updates. If the reviewer finds that deliverable is not ready, they can send the deliverable back to the writer for updating.

Once the outline is in the correct format, and has the appropriate content, the reviewer can approve it. Once approved, it is not possible to move back into this state, so please be careful about approvals!
