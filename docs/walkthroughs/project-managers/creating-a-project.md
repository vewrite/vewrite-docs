By default, Vewrite has no projects. You must create at least one before you can start creating deliverables. 

You can not create your first project without a team that has at least two users and is marked as ready, and a client to assign the project to.

To create a project, you must be a project manager. If you selected your persona as "writer", you can change this from your [Account settings](../users/setting-up-your-account.md).

Creating a project is easy. Just click the "create project" button and add a name.

Once you are ready, click "Create" and your team will be created.
