By default, Vewrite has no teams. You must create at least one, and add users to it. You can not create your first project without a team that has at least two users and is marked as ready.

To create a team, you must be a project manager. If you selected your persona as "writer", you can change this from your [Account settings](../users/setting-up-your-account.md).

Creating a team is easy. Just click the "create team" button and add a name.

Once you are ready, click "Create" and your team will be created.
