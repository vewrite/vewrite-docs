By default, Vewrite has no clients. You must create them and use them to give structure to your projects. You can not create your first project without a client.

To create a client, you must be a project manager. If you selected your persona as "writer", you can change this from your [Account settings](../users/setting-up-your-account.md).

Creating a client is easy. Just click the "create client" button and add a name and image to this client.

Once you are ready, click "Create" and your client will be created.
