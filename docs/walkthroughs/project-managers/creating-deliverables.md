Once you have a project set up, you'll be ready to start creating your deliverables.

Every deliverable that you create will be run through the project's workflow, and assigned to its team.

A new project will have no deliverables.

- **Internal type** - You'll be using the internal text editor, which is very similar in UX to Google Docs. If you're looking for the smoothest collaboration experience, you should use this type.
- **External type** - You'll be pointing to an external link, which allows you to maintain your current document editing experience. If you prefer to use Office 365 or Google Docs, you should use this type.
