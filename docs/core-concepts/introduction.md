## The Vewrite vision

We are so used to doing our work in one place, and our project management in another, that the idea of doing everything in one place seems counter-intuitive. But, at the end of the day, that's what Vewrite is. It is a single place for teams to work together, both as a way to stay organized and as a way to actually do the work itself. 

The advantage of this tight integration is that workflows can be tied directly into the project management, allowing events to trigger updates for the project itself. This means that as you do the work, Vewrite guides you through the workflow, ensuring that your team stays on-track, on-time, and on-budget.

## Core concepts

Vewrite has a few types of information that it uses to give structure to the product. Each of these are a core facet of the whole production cycle.

- Clients
- Teams
- Projects
- Deliverables
