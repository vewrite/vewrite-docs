## About Projects

Projects within Vewrite are the concept that bring all of the other concepts together into one working form. They are the engine and powerhouse of the machine.

Projects house Deliverables, and are used to hold together groups of related work so that the Project Manager can track the total progress.

### Roles and Permissions
Projects have two roles that define what functionality is available to you.

- **Owner** - If you are the creator of the project, you are by default the 'Project Manager' and you can create Deliverables, make assignments, and delete the project and its children.
- **Member** - If you are part of a team that has been assigned to a Project, you are a 'Member'. You are limited to working on the Deliverables and do not have access to creating Deliverables, making assignments, or project deletion.

### Requirements
Projects themselves have a few predicates. Without these you can not create a new Project.

- **Must have a Client** - A project has to be for someone, even if it is for yourself.
- **Must have a Team** - A project needs someone to work on it.
- **Must have a Workflow** - A project needs to know what steps it needs to run through.

### Limitations

Free accounts only allow one project to be created. If you need more than one project, you must have a Vewrite Pro account.
