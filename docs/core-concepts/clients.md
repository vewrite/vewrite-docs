## About clients

Vewrite is structured around the concept that your team will be writing for some external party. For companies that are service providers these are going to be external entities that are paying your group for writing services. For marketing or developer relations teams, these are going to be internal clients or the company that owns your team.

Clients are used to house critical information about who the stakeholder for the project is. This includes:

- The name of the stakeholder client entity
- An identifiable image used for visual reference within Vewrite
- The name of the stakeholder
- The position of the stakeholder
- The contact email of the stakeholder

This information is used within the state actions to notify the stakeholder when their deliverable is ready.
