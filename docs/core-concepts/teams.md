## About teams

Teams in Vewrite are used to house available writers and reviewers for use within the workflows that are used to run your projects.

Teams are created by a Project Manager. They are a predicate for creating a Project. A team must be marked as ready to use for it to be available for project creation.

Teams consist of at least two participants, a writer and a reviewer. The Project Manager is always added to a new team by default, but can be removed. Once the participants are added, the Project Manager can mark the team as ready to use.

Free accounts only allow one team to be created. If you need more than one team, you must have a Vewrite Pro account.
