## About Deliverables

Deliverables are the single-unit pieces of work that go into a Project. They are the written pieces which run through a workflow, with the output being an approved and delivered draft to the Client.

### Roles

Deliverables are worked on by at least two individuals within a Team. A deliverable will always be assigned to a:

- **Project Manager** - creates the requirements and starts the deliverable process
- **Writer** - does the writing of the outline and the draft
- **Reviewer** - reviews the outline and the draft, approves the final deliverable for the stakeholder 

Together, these roles allow a deliverable to be advanced successfully through a workflow.

### Requirements

Deliverables need to have a few things in place for them to be successful:

- Title - This differentiates it from the other deliverables in the project
- Requirements - This lets a writer know what the base expectations are for the deliverable
- Due date - This lets the writing team know how long they have
- Assigments - These are selected individuals from the team who have assigned roles that map to the workflow states
