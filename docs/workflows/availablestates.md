## About Vewrite's state types

Vewrite comes with an array of state types that can be used to customize your workflow to fit your team's exact needs.

The state types that are available in the system are:

- **New** - An initial state for a project with no associated actions. It only has an exit event
- **Research** - An information gathering phase where writers and project managers can collect and collate information relevant to the deliverable
- **Outline** - For outline creation before the writing phase
- **Outline Review** - Outlines may require review and approval, and this is the state for that
- **Writing** - In this state, writers convert the research, outline, and requirements into a draft
- **Draft Review** - The draft requires review, here that is done
- **Holding** - On occasion, a deliverable will be set aside, and this is the state that puts it in statis
- **Approved** - The deliverable is approved

Not all workflows will require all states.
