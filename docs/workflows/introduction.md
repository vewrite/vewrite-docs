## Structured Workflows

Structured workflows, which Vewrite relies upon heavily in its design, are simply a way to standardize the writing process so that it is more manageable and professional. These allow all participants in the process to know what they are supposed to do and when.

A good workflow will have:

- **Clear steps for all participants** - everybody should know what they are supposed to do
- **A logical order of operations** - each state should flow into the next
- **All work included** - at the end, you should be done

This means that you can take a project through a workflow from beginning to end and rest assured that when you've walked through it completely, there is nothing left to do.

A good workflow is peace of mind.
