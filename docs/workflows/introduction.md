## Structured Workflows

Structured workflows, which Vewrite relies upon heavily in its design, are simply a way to standardize the writing process so that it is more manageable and professional. These allow all participants in the process to know what they are supposed to do and when.

A good workflow will have:

- **Clear steps for all participants** - everybody should know what they are supposed to do
- **A logical order of operations** - each state should flow into the next
- **All work included** - at the end, you should be done

This means that you can take a project through a workflow from beginning to end and rest assured that when you've walked through it completely, there is nothing left to do.

A good workflow is peace of mind.

## Workflow Elements

Workflows are comprised of different state types. Each of these states has some properties assigned to it:

- A default assignee (e.g. project manager, writer, reviewer)
- Events (e.g. enter state, exit state)
- Actions (e.g. send notification, send email)

Together, these elements allow for a highly customizable and flexible workflow to be created. 

Vewrite comes with a default workflow that is refined and targeted at writing groups who require approval from a reviewer before completion. This fits most use-cases within marketing groups, developer relations units, and technical writing teams.
