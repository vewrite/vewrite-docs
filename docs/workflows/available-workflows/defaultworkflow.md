## About the Default Workflow

Vewrite's workflow is designed for writers who work in a group and have either a client or stakeholder who they are accountable to. This generally covers devrel units, marketing groups, and content creation teams who all together create technical pieces, articles, blogs, whitepapers, and proposals.

### The Workflow
#### Get Started
Our default workflow starts with the **project manager setting requirements**. These are just a few sentences that cover:

- What topic the writer is supposed to write about
- How long the piece needs to be
- Any links or references that the client has provided

#### Gather Information
Once the project manager starts the deliverable, the writer is assigned the piece. They are expected to **go and do some basic research** about the topic to ensure that they know what they are going to cover. Vewrite provides a place in the Document Manager to keep these notes as reference material for later in the writing process.

#### Create an Outline
When the writer feels that they are ready, they can **start writing their outline**. An outline is simply a structured set of bullet points that outline what the deliverable will cover. The point of this is to get a sign off early in the process from the client or stakeholder so that they can give feedback and input before the bulk of the work is done.

#### Outline Review
The writer completes the outline and passes it to the assigned reviewer. They have the opportunity to **provide critical feedback** now (and send it back to the writer for fixes), or to approve it as-is. Once approved, the deliverable can not be moved back this state.

#### Writing Draft
We now have a set of organized research notes, and an approved outline. **It's time to get to writing!**

#### Writing Review
As before with the outline review, the reviewer has the opportunity to **read the draft and provide comments and feedback** about the deliverable's draft. Once approved, the deliverable can not be moved back this state.

#### Approved
We now have an approved, completed draft that the stakeholder or client can **download as a Markdown or HTML file**.
